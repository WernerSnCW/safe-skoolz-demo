          <p>Bullying is when someone keeps being unkind to you <strong>on purpose</strong>, and it happens <strong>more than once</strong>. It's not just falling out with a friend or having a bad day — it's a pattern of behaviour that makes you feel scared, sad, or alone.</p>
          <p>Bullying can look like:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Physical</strong> — hitting, pushing, kicking, or taking your things</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal</strong> — name-calling, shouting, or saying mean things</li>
            <li><strong>Leaving out</strong> — deliberately not including someone, spreading rumours, or turning friends against someone</li>
            <li><strong>Online</strong> — sending mean messages, sharing embarrassing photos, or being cruel on social media</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure / control</strong> — forcing someone to do things they don't want to, or threatening them</li>
          </ul>

        <AccordionItem title="Have you been unkind to someone?" icon={Lightbulb}>
          <p>Sometimes people do unkind things. If you have been mean to someone, pushed them around, left them out on purpose, or said hurtful things — that takes courage to admit. <strong>Reading this is already a brave step.</strong></p>

          <div className="p-3 rounded-lg bg-primary/10 border border-primary/20 mt-2 mb-3">
            <p className="font-bold text-primary">Being unkind to someone doesn't make you a bad person. What matters is what you do next.</p>
          </div>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Why does it happen?</p>
          <p>People are unkind for lots of reasons. You might recognise some of these:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>You feel angry or stressed and you take it out on others</li>
            <li>Things are hard at home and it's making you feel bad inside</li>
            <li>You wanted to fit in or impress friends, so you went along with it</li>
            <li>Someone was unkind to you first and you passed that hurt on</li>
            <li>You didn't realise how much it was affecting the other person</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">None of these reasons make it okay — but understanding <em>why</em> helps you change.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Picking on someone weaker isn't being strong</p>
          <p>It might feel powerful to push someone around or say things that make others laugh. But real strength looks very different:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is standing up for someone, not against them</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is saying sorry and meaning it</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is walking away from a group that's being mean, even when it's hard</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is asking for help when you're struggling inside</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Children who bully are often struggling themselves. A punitive-only response rarely changes behaviour. Effective support combines clear boundaries with genuine pastoral care.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Why children bully</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Home difficulties</strong> — domestic conflict, neglect, abuse, or inconsistent parenting</li>
            <li><strong>Social pressure</strong> — seeking status, belonging, or peer approval</li>
            <li><strong>Past victimisation</strong> — children who have been bullied may replicate the behaviour</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional regulation difficulties</strong> — struggling with anger, frustration, or stress</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of empathy skills</strong> — not yet understanding how their actions affect others</li>

          <p>Hearing that your child has been unkind to others can be difficult. It's natural to feel defensive or upset. But how you respond now can make a real difference.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">First steps</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Listen to what the school tells you without being defensive — they are not attacking your child, they want to help</li>
            <li>Talk to your child privately and calmly — ask for their version, but make clear that bullying is not acceptable</li>
            <li>Avoid asking "What did they do to you first?" — this teaches them to justify unkind behaviour</li>
            <li>Help them understand how their actions affect others: "How would you feel if someone did that to you?"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Looking deeper</p>
          <p>Children who bully are often dealing with their own struggles. Consider whether any of these might apply:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Are there problems at home — arguments, a separation, a bereavement, financial stress?</li>
            <li>Has your child been bullied themselves, either now or in the past?</li>
            <li>Are they struggling with school work, friendships, or anxiety?</li>
            <li>Have they been exposed to aggressive behaviour from older siblings, peers, or media?</li>
            <li>Are they finding it hard to manage their emotions?</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">Bullying can sometimes be a child's way of asking for help when they don't have the words. Understanding the root cause doesn't excuse the behaviour, but it helps you address it properly.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Moving forward</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Work with the school on a support and behaviour plan</li>
            <li>Help your child practise empathy — discuss characters' feelings in books or TV shows</li>
            <li>Praise kind behaviour when you see it — reinforce the positive</li>
            <li>Set clear, consistent boundaries at home about how we treat others</li>
            <li>If the behaviour continues, ask the school about counselling or SENCO support</li>
