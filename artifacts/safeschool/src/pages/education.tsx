        <AccordionItem title="What is bullying?" icon={HelpCircle}>
          <p>Bullying is when someone keeps being unkind to you <strong>on purpose</strong>, and it happens <strong>more than once</strong>. It's not just falling out with a friend or having a bad day — it's a pattern of behaviour that makes you feel scared, sad, or alone.</p>
          <p>Bullying can look like:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Physical</strong> — hitting, pushing, kicking, or taking your things</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal</strong> — name-calling, shouting, or saying mean things</li>
            <li><strong>Leaving out</strong> — deliberately not including someone, spreading rumours, or turning friends against someone</li>
            <li><strong>Online</strong> — sending mean messages, sharing embarrassing photos, or being cruel on social media</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure / control</strong> — forcing someone to do things they don't want to, or threatening them</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="p-3 rounded-lg bg-secondary/10 border border-secondary/20 mt-2">

        <AccordionItem title="What is NOT bullying?" icon={CheckCircle2}>
          <p>Not everything that feels bad is bullying. These things can still be upsetting, but they are different:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>A one-off argument with a friend</li>
            <li>Someone accidentally bumping into you</li>
            <li>Not being picked for a team</li>
            <li>A teacher telling you off for breaking a rule</li>
            <li>Friends having a disagreement and then making up</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If any of these things keep happening on purpose, then it might become bullying — and you should still tell someone.</p>

        <AccordionItem title="Have you been unkind to someone?" icon={Lightbulb}>
          <p>Sometimes people do unkind things. If you have been mean to someone, pushed them around, left them out on purpose, or said hurtful things — that takes courage to admit. <strong>Reading this is already a brave step.</strong></p>

          <div className="p-3 rounded-lg bg-primary/10 border border-primary/20 mt-2 mb-3">
            <p className="font-bold text-primary">Being unkind to someone doesn't make you a bad person. What matters is what you do next.</p>
          </div>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Why does it happen?</p>
          <p>People are unkind for lots of reasons. You might recognise some of these:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>You feel angry or stressed and you take it out on others</li>
            <li>Things are hard at home and it's making you feel bad inside</li>
            <li>You wanted to fit in or impress friends, so you went along with it</li>
            <li>Someone was unkind to you first and you passed that hurt on</li>
            <li>You didn't realise how much it was affecting the other person</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">None of these reasons make it okay — but understanding <em>why</em> helps you change.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Picking on someone weaker isn't being strong</p>
          <p>It might feel powerful to push someone around or say things that make others laugh. But real strength looks very different:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is standing up for someone, not against them</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is saying sorry and meaning it</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is walking away from a group that's being mean, even when it's hard</li>
            <li><strong>Real strength</strong> is asking for help when you're struggling inside</li>
          </ul>

        <p className="font-bold mt-3">Right to information</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>You have the right to be informed promptly if your child is involved in a safeguarding incident — whether as a victim, witness, or perpetrator</li>

          <li>You have the right to receive updates on the progress and outcome of any investigation</li>
          <li>You have the right to receive a written summary of any formal protocol actions taken</li>

        <p className="font-bold mt-3">Right to be heard</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>You have the right to contribute your perspective during any investigation or protocol process</li>
          <li>You have the right to raise concerns directly — through SafeSkoolZ, by contacting your child's teacher, or by requesting a meeting with the Safeguarding Coordinator</li>
          <li>You have the right to formally disagree with the school's handling of a situation and to have your objection recorded</li>
          <li>You have the right to contact the PTA or school governance body if you feel concerns are not being addressed</li>

          <li>You have the right to know what data the school holds about your child and how it is used</li>
          <li>Incident reports involving your child are confidential — the school cannot share details about your child with other families without your consent</li>
          <li>Your child's diary entries are completely private — only they can see them. The AI safeguarding scanner may alert staff to concerns, but diary content is never shared</li>
          <li>You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your child's personal data (subject to safeguarding obligations)</li>

          <li>The school must request your consent before sharing incident details with classroom teachers beyond the Safeguarding Coordinator</li>

          <li>You have the right to withdraw consent at any time</li>

        <AccordionItem title="If your child is accused of bullying" icon={HelpCircle}>
          <p>Hearing that your child has been unkind to others can be difficult. It's natural to feel defensive or upset. But how you respond now can make a real difference.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">First steps</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Listen to what the school tells you without being defensive — they are not attacking your child, they want to help</li>
            <li>Talk to your child privately and calmly — ask for their version, but make clear that bullying is not acceptable</li>
            <li>Avoid asking "What did they do to you first?" — this teaches them to justify unkind behaviour</li>
            <li>Help them understand how their actions affect others: "How would you feel if someone did that to you?"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Looking deeper</p>
          <p>Children who bully are often dealing with their own struggles. Consider whether any of these might apply:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Are there problems at home — arguments, a separation, a bereavement, financial stress?</li>
            <li>Has your child been bullied themselves, either now or in the past?</li>
            <li>Are they struggling with school work, friendships, or anxiety?</li>
            <li>Have they been exposed to aggressive behaviour from older siblings, peers, or media?</li>
            <li>Are they finding it hard to manage their emotions?</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">Bullying can sometimes be a child's way of asking for help when they don't have the words. Understanding the root cause doesn't excuse the behaviour, but it helps you address it properly.</p>

          <p className="font-bold mt-3">Moving forward</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Work with the school on a support and behaviour plan</li>
            <li>Help your child practise empathy — discuss characters' feelings in books or TV shows</li>
            <li>Praise kind behaviour when you see it — reinforce the positive</li>
            <li>Set clear, consistent boundaries at home about how we treat others</li>
            <li>If the behaviour continues, ask the school about counselling or SENCO support</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="p-3 rounded-lg bg-primary/10 border border-primary/20 mt-3">
            <p className="font-bold text-primary">Your child is not defined by this behaviour. With the right support from home and school working together, children can and do change. What they need most right now is firm boundaries and genuine care.</p>
