## SafeSchool App (v0.2.0)

Multi-role safeguarding and incident reporting platform for schools.

### Auth & Roles
- JWT-based authentication (custom, bcrypt passwords/PINs)
- Roles: pupil, parent, teacher, head_of_year, coordinator, head_teacher, senco, support_staff
- Token stored in localStorage as `safeschool_token`
- `customFetch` in `lib/api-client-react/src/custom-fetch.ts` auto-injects Bearer token
- Staff visibility hierarchy:
  - teacher → sees assigned class only
  - head_of_year → sees all classes in assigned year group
  - head_teacher / coordinator / senco → sees all classes in school
  - support_staff → customised (className, yearGroup, or whole school)

### API Proxy
- Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8080`
- API server mounts all routes at `/api` prefix

### Database Schema
- Core: schools, users, incidents, protocols, interviews, notifications, patternAlerts, auditLog
- Compliance: delegatedRoles, annexTemplates, referralBodies, caseTasks
- Protocols extended with: riskFactors (jsonb), protectiveFactors (jsonb), familyContext (jsonb), externalReferralBodyId
- All in `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts`

### Compliance Frameworks
- **LOPIVI**: Protection delegate governance via delegated_roles, duty to report, safe environment assessments
- **Convivèxit 2024**: Anti-bullying protocol with 7 annexes (ANNEX-I through ANNEX-VII) in annex_templates
- **Machista Violence (CAIB)**: Gender-based violence protocol with 4 annexes (MV-I through MV-IV), risk/protective factors on protocols
- Delegated role types: lopivi_delegate, convivexit_coordinator, machista_protocol_lead, safeguarding_governor, senco_lead
- Referral body types: ib_dona, municipal_services, policia_nacional, guardia_civil, fiscalia_menores, servicios_sociales, salud_mental, caib_education

### Seed Data
- 1 school: Morna

- 2 parents: Parent A, Parent B (password: parent123)
- Run: `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed`
- Compliance data: 15 annex templates, 10 referral bodies, 4 delegated role appointments
- Run: `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed-compliance`

### Demo Credentials
- Coordinator A: coordinator@safeschool.dev / password123
- Head Teacher A: head@safeschool.dev / password123
- Teacher A (Head of Year Y6): teacher@safeschool.dev / password123
- Teacher B: teacher2@safeschool.dev / password123
- Teacher C: teacher3@safeschool.dev / password123
- Teacher D: teacher4@safeschool.dev / password123
- Support Staff A: support@safeschool.dev / password123
- SENCO A: senco@safeschool.dev / password123
- Parent A: parent.a@safeschool.dev / parent123
- Parent B: parent.b@safeschool.dev / parent123
- Pupils: Boy A, Boy B, Boy C, Boy D, Girl A, Girl B, Girl C, Girl D → PIN 1234

### Key Features
- Role-based login (pupil selector, staff/parent email login)
- **Quick Demo Login** panel on login page with instant one-click access for every role
- Incident reporting with emotional state tracking (multi-select), safeguarding checks (staff)
- **Person identification**: Pupil search-as-you-type for victims/perpetrators/witnesses + "I don't know their name" toggle showing structured description builder (gender, year, age relation, staff/pupil, physical description, friends, location seen, count). Descriptions tagged with roleInIncident (victim/perpetrator)
- **Unknown person descriptions** stored as JSONB on incidents (`unknownPersonDescriptions`), displayed on incident detail page with role badges
- Escalation tiers: sexual/coercive→tier3, physical/psychological/online→tier2, others→tier1
- **Incident filtering**: by child, year group, class, category, status
- Victim/perpetrator names shown on incident cards
- Pattern detection alerts (async, post-incident)
- **Protocol risk assessment**: Structured risk level (low/medium/high/critical) selector, fixed-category risk factor checkboxes (8 options), protective factor checkboxes (4 options), additional risk notes. All displayed on protocol detail page with color-coded badges
- Safeguarding protocols management
- Notifications with acknowledgment
- Audit logging
- Coordinator dashboard with stats

### Demo Incidents (seed-demo)
- 11 pre-seeded incidents across all categories and escalation tiers (child-friendly language throughout)
- Boy B appears in 4 incidents involving Boy A (repeated unkind behaviour pattern)
- Girl B: welfare concern (teacher noticed she needs extra support)
- Girl C: tier 3 safeguarding case (LOPIVI protocol)
- Girl D: feeling left out (exclusion)
- Boy D: being made fun of in class (anonymous report)
- Run: `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed-demo`

### Frontend Pages

## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references.

- **Always typecheck from the root** — run `pnpm run typecheck`
- **`emitDeclarationOnly`** — only `.d.ts` files emitted during typecheck
- **Project references** — packages declare dependencies via `references` array

## Root Scripts

- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + recursive build
- `pnpm run typecheck` — `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly`

## Important Notes

- bcrypt added to `onlyBuiltDependencies` in pnpm-workspace.yaml
- `useQueryClient` must be imported from `@tanstack/react-query`, NOT from `@workspace/api-client-react`
- Public pupil endpoint returns truncated last names (first initial only) for privacy
